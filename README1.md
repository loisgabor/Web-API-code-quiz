# Web-API-code-quiz

The scope of this project is to create a timed quiz, where when one question is given, DOM manipulation is used to erase all the content and bring up the next question with the four optional choices. This goes on for all five questions until you reach the end, or you run out of time. A new screen will appear requesting for the user initials to save their highschool.

## Usage

When user press button "start quiz" User will be presented with a question and multiple choice answers. When user would click an answer he/she would immediately be taken to the next question. There is timer element that counts down from 75 seconds.
